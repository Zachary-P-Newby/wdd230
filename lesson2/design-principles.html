            <p>BYU Pathways has a nice, clean, and simplistic desgin. It is easy to navigate, and does not overwelm the viewer with details. The use of whitespace, limited text and images keeps things sleek, and keep the focus on call to action buttons and statistics, allowing people to easily find what they need. The princeple of keeping things on seperate rows is especially good for mobile browsing.</p>

            <p>Blender is a 3d modeling software with a comprehensive documentation, so to make it easier to naivgate it is broken into sections. On the homepage, have a series of panels that each give you the option to jump to a specific section of the documentation. To show the relationship between them, each section panel has the same styling.</p>

            <p>Hick's Law states: "the more complex the options are, the longer it will take people to decide." So to take advantage of this, Wacom has broken their screenless pen tablets into three main groups, and displays the links to each group on the screenless pen tablets page. This keeps the page from overwhelming people with options and allows people to easily choose which type of tablet they want.</p>
